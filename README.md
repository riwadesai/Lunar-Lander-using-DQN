Key Techniques:
Deep Q-Network (DQN): A reinforcement learning algorithm where the agent learns from its experiences, stored in replay memory, to improve its decision-making over time.
Epsilon-Greedy Policy: A strategy that balances exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (using what it has learned) to find the optimal landing strategy.
Experience Replay: The agent stores its experiences (state, action, reward, next state) and samples them to learn more efficiently.
Results:
After training the agent over thousands of episodes, it consistently lands the spacecraft smoothly, achieving an average score well above the target.
